# sal-shop-clone
### A clone I made an e-commerce design I saw, to practice my front-end development skills and responsive web design. Reproducing web sites without using any of their original code is great practice.

### Technologies I used: 
- [jQuery-ui](https://jqueryui.com/) for the slider
- [BEM](https://en.bem.info/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
